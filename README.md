# SQL-Academy-Solutions

DESCRIPTION:

This repository contains my personal solutions to tasks from SQL Academy, a hands-on learning platform for SQL fundamentals and advanced querying.

It includes a wide variety of real-world SQL problems such as filtering, grouping, window functions, joins, subqueries, and performance optimization. The aim is to deepen my practical SQL knowledge while building a strong portfolio of database problem-solving skills.

Each solution is carefully written, and grouped by module. Some are also accompanied by alternative approaches.

Tech Stack: MySQL

This repo serves both as a personal study log and a reference for anyone interested in learning SQL through problem-based learning.
